Guessing The Number Game Using Python.In Python, the "Guess the Number" game is a fun and simple interactive program where the computer selects a random number within a given range (usually between 1 and 100), and the player tries to guess it. The program provides feedback on each guess, telling the player whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. It uses a loop to allow multiple guesses until the player finds the correct number. Random number generation is handled using Python's random module, and user input is gathered with the input() function. This game helps beginners practice loops, conditional statements, and user interaction in Python.
